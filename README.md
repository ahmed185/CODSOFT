This repository contains the code for three projects completed during the CodeSoft Internship:
1. Task-1: Movie Genre Classification

This project explores the task of classifying movies into different genres based on their descriptions or other features. It could involve techniques like natural language processing (NLP) for text analysis, feature extraction, and building a classification model.

2. Task-2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. It might involve analyzing transaction data, identifying patterns in fraudulent behavior, and building a model to predict future fraud.


3. Task-3: Detecting Spam Messages

This project explores techniques for classifying email messages as spam or not spam. It likely involves building a machine learning model using techniques like text pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
